# Fraud Detection System for Financial Transactions

## Overview
This repository contains a real-time fraud detection system for financial transactions, designed to identify fraudulent activities with high accuracy while minimizing false positives. The system leverages advanced machine learning techniques and a robust architecture to ensure effective fraud detection.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a system that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, potentially saving millions in losses for financial institutions.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Simulation
- Synthetic dataset creation for financial transactions, including features like transaction amount, time, location, and merchant category.
- Simulation of both normal and fraudulent transaction patterns.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analysis of transaction patterns and identification of key features correlated with fraud.
- Visualization of temporal and geographical distributions of fraudulent activities.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Creation of aggregated features (e.g., transaction frequency, average amount) over various time windows.
- Implementation of geospatial features (e.g., distance from usual locations).
- Development of user profiling features based on historical transaction patterns.

### 4. Handling Imbalanced Data
- Application of advanced resampling techniques such as SMOTE and ADASYN.
- Exploration of cost-sensitive learning approaches to address class imbalance.

### 5. Model Development
- Implementation and comparison of multiple models:
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (LightGBM, XGBoost)
  - Deep Learning models (Neural Networks with attention mechanisms)
  - Anomaly detection techniques (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
- Development of an ensemble model combining multiple approaches for robust performance.

### 6. Real-time Scoring System
- Design of a streaming architecture for real-time transaction scoring using Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming.
- Implementation of a model serving layer with sub-second latency requirements.

### 7. Model Monitoring and Updating
- Development of a system to monitor model performance and detect concept drift.
- Implementation of an automated retraining pipeline to keep the model updated with new patterns.

### 8. Explainable AI
- Integration of SHAP or LIME explanations for each flagged transaction.
- Creation of a dashboard for fraud analysts to review and understand model decisions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Streaming Platforms**: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark
- **Model Management**: MLflow

## Outcome
The system aims to achieve X% precision and Y% recall in identifying fraudulent transactions while processing Z transactions per second. This capability can significantly mitigate financial losses due to fraud.
